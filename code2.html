    <h1>Facts about NYC</h1>
    <p>Did you know that...?</p>
    <ol>
      <li>NYC's POPULATION DENSITY IS THE HIGHEST OF ANY AMERICAN CITY.</li>
        <p>New York isn’t known for its shoulder room.
           With over 27,000 people per square mile, it’s not just the densest major city,
           it also accounts for more than 40 percent of New York State’s entire population.</p>
      <li>IT WOULD TAKE APPROXIMATELY 24 HOURS TO NAVIGATE THE ENTIRE SUBWAY SYSTEM.</li>
        <p>And that’s if you’re in a rush. With 34 lines and 469 stops,
           the New York City subway system is one of the largest urban mass transportation systems in the world.
           Traveling to every single stop (without leaving the transit system)
           will take you at least 21 hours and 49 minutes—traverse the whole system in less time than that,
           and you’ll have broken the current world record.</p>
